  description: A simple REST API which shows one's books (using OAuth) in Google Books as JSON or CSV. The original idea was to show a unified view of one's books in Google Books and Amazon Kindle. Alas, accessing Kindle's list is trickier. Especially when Amazon doesn't want you to...

  description: An alternative [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) implementation for Lua. Written mainly as an excuse to check out [re](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/re.html), and later [telescope](https://github.com/norman/telescope) for Mustache's specs.

  description: An amusing, Lisp-inspired trick for Java generics to accept an open-ended list of type variables. The possibility occurred to me one day, and I'd messed around with [type tokens](http://gafter.blogspot.com/2006/12/super-type-tokens.html) before, so it was a quick hack :)
