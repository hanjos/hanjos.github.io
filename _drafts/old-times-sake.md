In search of content to at least have _something_ published, I have rediscovered my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). 

After recovering from the surprise that the service still exists ([Google Reader feelings](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html)), I have engaged in a fascinating trip through an incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!). 

Even though a lot has linkrotted, and some of the blogs have stopped publishing...
