Somehow, I have stumbled upon my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). 

I'm surprised the service still exists. But it does look like something Google forgot is still live. And I've seen that before with [Google Reader](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-the-book-on-reader-announces-july-1-sunset/)...

It has been a fascinating trip through a varied, incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!) of stuff that once interested me. Even though a lot has linkrotted, and some of the stuff is now obsolete or no longer needed, there are several gems worth revisiting, and even discovering:

* Programming and CS coolnesses (dunno if the word even exists, but it should :P)
* Random blogs
* Miscellaneous forums about random subjects
* Starred places in Google Maps which I _just couldn't_ unstar within Google Maps, no matter how much I tried (so here's where they were...)

Given Google's history with apparently abandoned projects, Google Bookmarks doesn't look long for this world. So it's time for alternatives. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) seems nice, and it can read Bookmarks' export file. And even though Pocket sells itself as [a reading list](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pros-cons-pocket/), not a bookmarking service, it's close enough for my purposes. 

But why not just hack something right here? I could whip something up in a jiffy with Jekyll, Git provides easy backups for the data, and I own the domain. Of course, some of the most "advanced" features would be missing (Pocket's [apps and integrations](https://getpocket.com/apps/) are nice, and saving snapshots of the articles is cool). But I wouldn't depend on a third party service for a relatively simple task. Hm...
