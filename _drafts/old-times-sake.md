# For old times sake

In search of content to at least have _something_ published, I have rediscovered my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). I'm surprised the service still exists ([Google Reader R.I.P.](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html)).

It has been an fascinating trip through an incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!) of stuff that once interested me. 

I didn't get into social bookmarking at the time. Now that I started seeing some benefits, the idea seems to be mostly dead.
