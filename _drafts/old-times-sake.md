I have rediscovered my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). 

I'm surprised the service still exists. That being said, it looks like something they forgot is still live, which is what happened to Google Reader...

It's a fascinating trip through an incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!) of stuff that once interested me.

Even though a lot has linkrotted, and some of the blogs have stopped publishing... 

Work-related stuff which is now obsolete or no longer needed...

Programming and CS curios... 

Various forums about various subjects...

Starred places in Google Maps which I _just couldn't_ unstar within Google Maps, no matter how much I tried (so here's where they were...)... 

I cleaned my Google Bookmarks up some. Deleted linkrotten or no-longer-relevant links, updated others...

I could use a social bookmarking service. That hasn't been a _thing_ for some time, but some decent services out there... Pocket seems like an option. It's [not quite a bookmarking service](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pros-cons-pocket/), but that shouldn't be a problem...

Why not put it here? I could whip something up in a jiffy...
