# For old times sake

In search of content to at least have _something_ published, I have rediscovered my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). I'm surprised the service still exists (Google Reader R.I.P.).

It has been an fascinating trip through an incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!) of stuff that once interested me, but fell by the wayside. 

I didn't got into social bookmarking at the time, and now that I started seeing some benefits, the idea seems to be mostly dead.
