Somehow, I have stumbled upon my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). 

I'm surprised the service still exists. But it does look like something Google forgot is still live. And I've seen that before with [Google Reader](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-the-book-on-reader-announces-july-1-sunset/)...

It has been a fascinating trip through a varied, incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!) of stuff that once interested me. Even though a lot has linkrotted, and some of the stuff is now obsolete or no longer needed, there are several gems worth revisiting. They'll probably end up here, after a sifting through to remove what history left behind.

Given Google's [history](https://killedbygoogle.com/), Bookmarks doesn't look long for this world; so it's time to look for alternatives. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) seems nice, it can read Bookmarks' export file, and even though it sells itself as [a reading list](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pros-cons-pocket/), not a bookmarking service, it's close enough for my purposes. And I could retrieve some data from Pocket to show stuff right here on the site. As far as I understand, I could make [the RSS feeds](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1074-can-i-subscribe-to-my-list-via-rss?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier)  publically available, so that some JavaScript would extract the data and build the page.

Or, why not just hack something right here? I could whip something up in a jiffy with Jekyll and some JavaScript, Git provides easy backups for the data, and I own the domain. Of course, some of the most "advanced" features would be missing (Pocket's [apps and integrations](https://getpocket.com/apps/) are nice, and sharing is caring). But I wouldn't depend on a third party service for a relatively simple task. And I could even store the bookmarks in a Pocket-readable format (is there a standard?) to aid any future migration.

Hum...
