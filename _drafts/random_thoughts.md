A blog post isn't the best place for an idea dump, but what the hell; these are early days :)

So here goes some random thoughts and concepts that I've been pondering:

#### Games in chat apps

I've read some on the Internet about how chatbots "are the new thing", "a whole new way to interact with users" (dunno, 
in my general experience it only adds "a how to reach a human" step to the process, but to each their own). 

Well, how about a game in chat? Besides the more obvious MUDs? Ideally one which could be made multiplayer (create a 
group, go nuts). Maybe something turn-based, XCOM style...

#### MMORPGs with more than combat

I've tried playing MMOs. But the idea that captured my imagination was "persistent world". Thing is, to me that means 
"being able to change the world", and most games go for the theme park/grinding style. I can see why: not every paying 
subscriber can be a warrior-god world saver, and there's no way the devs can come up with new content all the time. 
Theme park/grinding is just easier, and seems to be enough to pay the bills. For some games, at least.

I don't have a solution. But there are some things I'd like to see:

* Other career choices besides "adventurer". Maybe if there were something else to do (something fun, of course) besides 
Killing and Looting&trade;, the subsequent inevitable arms race could be stemmed, and more possibilities explored.
 
  * A bard, along with some rhythm-based minigames, might be interesting. I can visualize a player using a Guitar Hero 
controller on jam night at the tavern. And it could be useful in adventuring too, with the player 'playing' their 
spells into existence. 

* Instead of explicit karma, griefers could be marked as wanted, with other players being able to act as bounty hunters. 
With adequate bounties, this could be a way for players to police themselves. And griefers to be constantly harassed by 
PCs and NPCs alike. And for the griefers' friends to become wanted as well for aiding and abetting.  

* A spell could be an actual program, 'coded' by wizards. Different schools of magic could be different programming 
'paradigms', with different mechanisms (good ol' scrolls, Guitar Hero-like instruments; microphone-based chanting; 
Just Dance-like ritual dancing; drawings on a surface; bargaining with ancient spirits...). Some spells could be 
'packaged' (think Staff of Lightning and the like) and sold. Of course, such a flexible and non-game-breaking magical 
system is worthy of a game of its own.
