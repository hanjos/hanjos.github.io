Somehow, I have stumbled upon my old [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/). 

I'm surprised the service is still live. But it does look like something Google forgot about. And I've seen that before with [Google Reader](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-the-book-on-reader-announces-july-1-sunset/)...

It has been a fascinating trip through a varied, incomplete and not-that-recent history (the oldest entry is from 11 years ago!) of stuff that once interested me. Even though a lot has linkrotted, and some of the stuff is now obsolete or no longer needed, there are several gems worth revisiting. They'll probably end up here, after some sifting through to remove what history left behind.

Given Google's [history](https://killedbygoogle.com/), Bookmarks doesn't look long for this world; so it's time to look for alternatives. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) seems nice, it can read Bookmarks' export file, and even though it sells itself as [a reading list](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pros-cons-pocket/), not a bookmarking service, it's close enough for my purposes. If I could retrieve some data from Pocket to show stuff right here on the site (I could read [the RSS feeds](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1074-can-i-subscribe-to-my-list-via-rss?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier), for example), a little JavaScript would be enough to extract the data and build the page.

Or, why not just hack something right here? I could whip something up in a jiffy with Jekyll, Git provides easy backups for the data, and I own the domain. Of course, some features would be missing (Pocket's [apps and integrations](https://getpocket.com/apps/) are nice, and sharing is caring). But I wouldn't depend on a third party service for a relatively simple task. And I could even store the bookmarks in a Pocket-readable format (is there a standard for this stuff?) to aid any future migration.
