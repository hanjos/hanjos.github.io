## Site

I've first heard the word "sbrubbles" on the radio at some point in the mid-to-late 90's, and AFAIK, it's just a nonsensical funny-sounding word. Also, I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :)

This site is written mostly in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), compiled by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here's [the source code](https://github.com/hanjos/hanjos.github.io) for this site. The icons were obtained at [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/), and I'm using system font stacks for sans serif, serif and monospace.

My profile image is the [Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR4N5OhcY9s), from [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/), the greatest hat simulator ever (it even has an FPS!).
