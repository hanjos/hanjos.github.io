# This

This site is written mostly in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), compiled by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here's [the source code](https://github.com/hanjos/hanjos.github.io). 

I'm using system font stacks for sans serif, serif and monospace. 

My profile image is the [Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR4N5OhcY9s) from [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/), the greatest hat simulator ever (there's even an embedded FPS!). The favicons were generated from the profile image using [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/); the other icons were obtained at [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).
