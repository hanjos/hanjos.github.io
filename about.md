# Me

Hi! My name is **Humberto Anjos**. Currently I'm an *Enterprise Architect*&trade;, but the joy of coding never goes away... 

So I built this site to dust off some of those skills, and pile up some of my interests (my [bookmarks](/bookmarks.html) should be a good hint of those), projects and musings in my own cozy little place of the Internet. 

Besides, I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :) 

I've accumulated accounts in several sites and social networks over the years; the profile image might give me away. But the most relevant are on the footer, and reproduced below:

* **E-mail:** [h.anjos](mailto:h.anjos@sbrubbles.org)
* **Github:** [hanjos](https://github.com/hanjos)
* **Steam:** [To Punch Garlic](https://steamcommunity.com/id/topunchgarlic)
* **Wordpress:** [humanjos](https://patosdoinferno.wordpress.com/author/humanjos/)

# This

This site is written mostly in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), compiled by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here's [the source code](https://github.com/hanjos/hanjos.github.io). 

I'm using system font stacks for sans serif, serif and monospace. 

My profile image is the [Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR4N5OhcY9s) from [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/), the greatest hat simulator ever (there's even an embedded FPS!). The favicons were generated from the profile image using [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/); the other icons were obtained at [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).
