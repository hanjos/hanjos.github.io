    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This page is a work in progress.</p> 
    <p>I haven't decided yet if I'm going Jekyll, Jekyll-like, rolling my own, or going raw HTML/CSS/Javascript. 
      All options involve studying up and dusting off mostly unused knowledge (to varying degrees), and I 
      haven't decided what this page is actually <em>for</em> yet.</p>
    <p>So it might take a while...</p>
