My name is **Humberto Anjos**. Once upon a time, I wrote code for a living. Officially it's not my job anymore, but that never stopped anybody ;) 

I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :) But I'm not quite sure what I'll use this site [for](http://wiki.c2.com/?EndingWithaPreposition). Right now it's looking like this will be my dumping ground for any random links, musings and experiments I develop/stumble on along the way.

In any case, I’m still tinkering away. Let’s see how far this goes...
