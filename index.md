My name is **Humberto Anjos**. Once upon a time, I wrote code for a living. Officially that's not my job anymore, but technicalities should never get in the way of a good coding, right? And I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :) 

I have developed several interests throughout the years, like programming, computer science, games (both analog and digital), swords, drums, the NBA and investing. I'm not quite sure what I'll use this site [for](http://wiki.c2.com/?EndingWithaPreposition), but right now it's looking like this will be my dumping ground for any random links, musings and experiments I develop/stumble on along the way. 

In any case, I’m still tinkering away. Let’s see how far this goes...
