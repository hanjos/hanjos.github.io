My name is **Humberto Anjos**. I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :) 

But I'm not quite sure what I'll use this site [for](http://wiki.c2.com/?EndingWithaPreposition). Right now it looks like this will be my dumping ground for any random links, musings and experiments I develop/stumble on along the way.

Letâ€™s see how far this goes...
