My name is **Humberto Anjos**. Once upon a time, I wrote code for a living. Officially it's not my job anymore, but that never stopped anybody ;) 

I have developed several interests throughout the years, like programming, computer science, games (both analog and digital), swords, drums, the NBA and investing. I'm not quite sure what I'll use this site [for](http://wiki.c2.com/?EndingWithaPreposition), but right now it's looking like this will be my dumping ground for any random links, musings and experiments I develop/stumble on along the way. Also, I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :) 

In any case, I’m still tinkering away. Let’s see how far this goes...
