My name is **<a href="https://sbrubbles.org/" class="h-card" rel="me">Humberto Anjos</a>**. This is my own cozy little corner of the Internet, a place to pile up any random links, musings and experiments I develop/stumble on along the way. 

And I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :) 

One can find me on several sites and social networks, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/hanjos), [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/topunchgarlic) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/humberto-anjos-7b005b95/), follow the stuff here via [RSS](/feed.xml), or reach me via [e-mail](mailto:h.anjos@sbrubbles.org). The footer holds the most relevant links.

Letâ€™s see how far this goes...
