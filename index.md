# Hi! 

My name is **Humberto Anjos**. Once upon a time, I wrote code for a living. Officially that's not my job anymore, but technicalities should never get in the way of a good coding, right? 

I have developed several interests throughout the years, ranging from programming and computer science to games (both analog and digital), NBA and investing. I'm not quite sure what I'll use this site [for](http://wiki.c2.com/?EndingWithaPreposition), but right now it's looking like this will be my dumping ground for any random links, musings and experiments I develop/stumble on along the way. And I've been using `org.sbrubbles` as my Java package root for years, so it's neat to finally own the domain :)

In any case, I’m still tinkering. Let’s see how far this goes...
