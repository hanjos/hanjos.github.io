<blockquote>This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine.</blockquote>

Here are all my blog posts, tagged, excerpted and ordered chronologically for your appreciation. I can't promise any frequency, correctness, usefulness or even sanity, but, well, go nuts :P

<h1>Latest posts</h1>

<div class='posts'>
  <ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      {% include post-entry.html post=post show_tags=true show_excerpt=true %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
